# 🏗️ Optimal Road Construction Using Kruskal's Algorithm

## 📊 Overview
This project demonstrates how **Kruskal's Algorithm** can be used to determine the **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** for optimal road construction between cities at the **minimum possible cost**. The algorithm helps connect cities while ensuring no cycles and minimal total cost, making it ideal for real-world applications like network design and urban planning.

## 🌟 Features
- ✅ **Kruskal’s Algorithm** to compute the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
- 🏙️ **Dynamic User Input** for cities, roads, and construction costs
- 💰 **Total Construction Cost** calculation
- 🗺️ **Map Integration** (India map as a visual aid)
- 📱 **Responsive UI** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
- ✨ Clear visualization of optimal connections and costs

## 💡 How It Works
1. **Input the number of cities** you want to connect.
2. **Enter road connections** in the format: `CityA,CityB,Cost` (e.g., `0,1,10; 0,2,5; 1,3,15`).
3. **Click "Calculate Optimal Roads"** — the app will apply **Kruskal’s Algorithm** to compute the MST.
4. View the **optimal connections** and the **total construction cost**.
